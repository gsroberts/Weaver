Weaver
======

A cloud-based PGP Web of Trust manager written in Node.js that implements an authoritative key server and makes use of OpenPGP.js to provide robust key managment tools.  Weaver will also expose a services layer that will allow the integration of third-party tools and eliminate the need to copy sets of keys between multiple computers that may be used for signing and encrypting/decrypting emails, documents or other objects using PGP with the overall goal of helping make PGP ubiquitous in terms of a secure way to communicate with others.
